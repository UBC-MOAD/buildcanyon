* ##[3DBathymetry.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/buildcanyon/raw/tip/Bathymetry/3DBathymetry.ipynb)  
    
    Generate 3D bathymetry graphics from a binary file prepared for MITgcm submarine canyon simulations 
    
    * ##[3DBathymetryBarkleylike.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/buildcanyon/raw/tip/Bathymetry/3DBathymetryBarkleylike.ipynb)  
    
    Generate 3D bathymetry graphics from a binary file prepared for MITgcm submarine canyon simulations using characteristic dimensions of Barkley Canyon.  



* ##[GenerateNonUniformBathymetry360x360.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/buildcanyon/raw/tip/Bathymetry/GenerateNonUniformBathymetry360x360.ipynb)  
    
    Generate a bathymetry file (as well as delx and dely files) with non uniform resolution. Minimum resolution is 200 m near the canyon along shore and across shore.  

* ##[Generate2CanyonBathy.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/buildcanyon/raw/tip/Bathymetry/GenerateNonUniformBathymetry360x360.ipynb)  
    
    Generate a 2-canyon bathymetry file (as well as delx and dely files) with non uniform resolution. Minimum resolution is 200 m near the canyons along shore and across shore.
